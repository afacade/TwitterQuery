Uses the Twitter API to collect tweets from chosen users, then query them based on my input of keywords. In simpler words, if I input "Hat", then the program will automatically output any tweet that contains "Hat" from a pool of twitter handles that I chose. ( including dates, Twitter handle, Tweet text, Tweet Url, Tweet media url). 

Please input your twitter authentication tokens in insert.php.
Also input your hosting with database login information in insert.php and dao/connection.php.
P.S I'm hosting on XAMPP's localhost.# Twitter-Query
